/* As with the previous portfolio Challenge, remember that "good" design is subjective; however, your site should look polished. Here are a few guidelines on what that means:
Use mobile-first design.
Choose a color palette so that your site doesn't just look like the default Bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site. Look into resources like Coolors Links to an external site. or another color scheme generator to help you create something that will stand out.
Make sure the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
Consider using animations and React component libraries. Note that this will not affect your grade, but it may impact how potential employers gauge your knowledge. */
